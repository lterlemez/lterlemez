*** Some Statistical Calculation Examples For Grouped Frequency Series in Excel

Excel has a large function library, including statistical ones varying from arithmetic mean to Gamma probability function. But, one of the problems is that most of these functions accepts data as simple series. And, sometimes, even statisticians may have to work with other series like frequency or grouped frequency series/tables/distributions. Excel also has some functions in its library that can help to do math but again, you have to tell Excel how to do!
So, here, I have some simple code samples to calculate more easily in Excel.
